Instructions for running the programming:
    - extract zip file
    - open terminal in project directory
    - enter the following commands 
        make
        ./sim_1 <config file name>
    - example config_1.conf and Test_1a.mdf are provided in the project directory 
Note: Only file names without any space in between, separated by a single '.' and having appropriate extension is a valid file name


Architecture:
    -program starts in Simulator.c. 
    -Both configuration and metadata files are read, parsed and stored in respective structs.See Configuration.c and Metadata.C for their definitions.
    -A generic LinkedList class was defined using void pointers. At the moment the only place it's being used in is inside the metadata struct. Currently it doesn't support dynamic reallocation, so initial size is the limit. Will fix that in next update. 
    -Utils.c defines various general useful functions. File reading and writing is also done inside this. Files are opened only once as specified for both reading and writing.
    -Logger.c contains all logging specific functions. 
    -All files(except Simulator) have a header of the same name with declarations 
    -Memory management isn't all done yet. Will be done by next update. 
    
 
Error and output handling:
    -Although you stated that you are only going to change values in the configuration file (and spaces between instructions), I tried to make the program to be able to handle every situation (some unforeseen cases may still cause issues though). Configuration file data is logged until an error occurs ( exception : Critical error like missing statement or configuration file is empty etc are reported first).
    -Metadata file is logged only if there was no error in configuration file.
    -All parsing errors are reported with configuration or metadata file name with appropriate line number.
    -If a crucial statement is missing, for example if configuration file has no mention of a Log target (Monitor, File, both) the line number isn't reported and will be reported immediately. On the other hand, some statements are allowed to be missing.For example, configuration file may not contain a cycle time for Keyboard and that is valid. However, Metadata shouldn't try to access this value as it will get a 0 value and end up with a total cycle time of 0 ms.
