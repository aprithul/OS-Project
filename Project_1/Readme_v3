Instructions for running the programming:
    - extract zip file
    - open terminal in project directory
    - enter the following commands 
        make
        ./sim_1 <config file name>
    - example config_1.conf and Test_1a.mdf are provided in the project directory 

Note: Only file names without any space in between, separated by a single '.' and having appropriate extension is a valid file name

For project 3, I built upon previous work in following ways:
    - Projector and Hard Disk resources are synchronised using sempahores ( since they can have more than one instance )
    - All other resources synchronised using mutex
    - Memory allocated according to block size
    - Proper error handling for newly added features

    
......................................................................................................
Architecture Development:  
    - Resource.h contains declaration for Resources struct. Resources holds all mutex and semaphores as well as hdd and projector count
    - IO.c modified to incorporate synchronization. All output and input componenets now have their specific threads with proper mutex/semaphores. see line 9-16, 22-29, 35-42, 49-56, 62-69, 75-82 of file: IO.c to see mutex/semaphores implementation.
    - Memory.c modified so that memory address isn't assigned randomly but starting from 0x0 and incremented by block size. If allocation would exceed system memory, new allocation is done from address 0x0.
